This is the repository for a personal portfolio website.

https://sargupta.herokuapp.com

## To run locally

Download or clone the repo and change directory:

`git clone git@github.com:sar-gupta/sar-gupta.github.io.git`

`cd sar-gupta.github.io`

Install dependencies: 

`yarn`

Running the project:

`yarn run dev-server`

This will start up the webpack-dev-server. However, if you want to build the project locally and run it through express, follow the following commands after installing dependencies:

`yarn run build`

`yarn start`

### NOTE

Refactoring still needs to be done, a separate Title component, and a Project component still need to be made. Right now, there is repetitive code in components instead of separate components for these.
